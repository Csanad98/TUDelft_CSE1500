    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <!--For the most part, HTML elements are displayed in one of two ways. The first way is
inline, which applies to elements that have the type a or span, for example. This means
(among other things) that the content will appear on the same line as the surrounding
content:-->
    <div>
         This is a paragraph and this <span>word</span> appears inline. This
        <a href="http://www.example.com">link</a> will also appear inline.
    </div>


    <!--It’s actually more common for elements to be block elements instead of inline elements.
This means that the content contained inside the element will appear on a new
line outside of the normal flow of text. Block elements that we’ve seen include the p,
nav, main, and div elements-->
    <!--In this case they don't appear inline-->
    <div>
            This is a paragraph and this <div>word</div> appears inline. This
            <a href="http://www.example.com">link</a> will also appear inline.
            </div>
